This specification describes a mechanism to protect legacy optical barcodes,
such as those found on driver's licenses (PDF417) and travel documents (MRZ),
using Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]. The Verifiable Credential
representations are compact enough such that they fit in under 140 bytes and
can thus be integrated with traditional two-dimensional barcodes that are
printed on physical cards using legacy printing processes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">

      <p>
This specification is experimental.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
Legacy documentation, such as driver's licenses, passports, and travel
credentials often include machine-readable data that can be used to
quickly read the information from the document. This information is
encoded in formats such as PDF417, machine-readable zone (MRZ), and other
optically scannable codes that are formatted in one-dimensional or
two-dimensional "bars"; thus the name "barcode". This information is often not
protected from tampering and the readily available barcode generation and
scanning libraries mean that it is fairly trivial for anyone to generate
these barcodes.
      </p>
      <p>
It is, therefore, useful for an <a>issuer</a> of these barcodes to protect
the information contained within the barcode as well as the entity that
generated the barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
The [[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] specification provides a global standard for
expressing credential information, such as those in a driver's license or
travel document. The [[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] specification provides a global
standard for securing credential information. These two specifications, when
combined, provide a means of protecting credentials from tampering,
expressing authorship of the credential, and providing the current status of
a credential in a privacy-protecting manner. These data formats, however, tend
to be too large to express in an optical barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
The [[[CBOR-LD]]] specification provides a means of compressing secured
<a>verifiable credentials</a> to the point at which it becomes feasible to
express the information as an optical barcode, or embedded within an optical
barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification describes a mechanism to protect legacy optical barcodes,
such as those found on driver's licenses (PDF417) and travel documents (MRZ),
by using a <a>verifiable credential</a> [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] to express
information about the barcode, which is then secured using Data Integrity
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]], and then compressed using CBOR-LD [[CBOR-LD]]. The
resulting <a>verifiable credential</a> representations are compact enough such
that they fit in under 140 bytes and can thus be integrated with traditional
two-dimensional barcodes that are printed on physical cards using legacy
printing processes. This adds tamper resistance to the barcode while
optionally enhancing the barcode to provide information related to whether or
not the physical document has been revoked or suspended by the <a>issuer</a>.
      </p>

        <h3>Driver's License Example</h3>

        <p>
This section provides an example on how the technology in this specification
can be utilized to secure the optical barcode on a driver's license that
uses a PDF417 barcode. We start off with an example driver's license:
        </p>

        <figure id="dl-front">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"

               alt="Picture of the front of a driver's license issued by the state of Utopia which contains a picture of the individual that is the subject of the driver's license along with their attributes, such as name, address, height, weight, eye color, and driving privileges.">

        </figure>

        <p>
The back of the driver's license contains a PDF417 barcode:
        </p>

        <figure id="dl-back">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"

               alt="Picture of the back of a driver's license issued by the state of Utopia, containing usage rules as well as a PDF417 barcode that encodes much of the information displayed on the front of the card.">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
A back of a driver's license issued by the state of Utopia.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The PDF417 data contains information that is secured using the algorithms
described in this specification. Namely, the PDF417 barcode contains the
following <a>verifiable credential</a>.

        <h3>Employment Authorization Example</h3>

        <p>
This section provides an example on how the technology in this specification
can be utilized to secure the machine-readable zone on an employment
authorization document that uses a machine-readable zone (MRZ) on the back of
the card. We start off with an example employment authorization document:
        </p>

        <figure id="ead-front">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"
               src="diagrams/ead-front.png"
               alt="Picture of the front of an employment authorization document issued by the state of Utopia which contains a picture of the individual that is the subject of the document along with their attributes, such as name, address, height, weight, eye color, and employment privileges.">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The front of an employment authorization document issued by the state of Utopia.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The back of the employment authorization document contains a machine-readable
zone (MRZ) containing information designed to be read through optical character
recognition:
        </p>

        <figure id="ead-back">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"

A back of an employment authorization document issued by the state of Utopia.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The MRZ data contains information that is secured using the algorithms
described in this specification. Namely, the QR Code on the front of the
card contains the following <a>verifiable credential</a>, which secures
the information on the back of the card.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
to express [=verifiable credentials=] that secure optically printed information
such as barcodes and machine-readable zones on travel documents.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>OpticalBarcodeCredential</h3>

        <p>
An `OpticalBarcodeCredential` is used to secure the contents of an optical
barcode in a way that provides 1) authorship information , 2) tamper
resistance, and 3) optionally, revocation and suspension status. In other words,
the credential can tell you who issued the optical barcode, if the
optical barcode has been tampered with since it was first issued, and
whether or not the <a>issuer</a> of the optical barcode still warrants that
the document is still valid or not. These features provide significant
anti-fraud protections for physical documents.
        </p>

        <p>
The `credentialSubject` of an `OpticalBarcodeCredential` is either a
`Pdf417Barcode` or a `MachineReadableZone`. A `Pdf417Barcode` signifies that
the <a>verifiable credential</a> secures the PDF417 barcode on the physical
document as well as the information expressed in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>. A `MachineReadableZone` signifies that
the <a>verifiable credential</a> secures the machine-readable zone on the
physical document as well as the information expressed in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
In order to achieve as much compression as possible, it is RECOMMENDED that the
`issuer` and `verificationMethod` fields utilize terms from a JSON-LD Context,
which

An example of an optical barcode credential that utilizes the properties
specified in this section is provided below:

A `TerseBitstringStatusListEntry` is a subclass of a `BitstringStatusListEntry`
as defined in the [[[VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST]]] specification, where only the
status list index is provided. The location of the status lists are discovered
through the issuer DID Document via the `service` property.

The `BitstringStatusListService` identifies a specific type of service that
utilizes a URL template that uses information from the
<a>verifiable credential</a> to determine the revocation and suspension status
list URLs. The `{{YYYY}}` and `{{MM}}` template values are replaced with the
issuance year and month, respectively, of the <a>verifiable credential</a>
which are encoded in the `proof`. The resulting document MUST be a
<a data-cite="VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST#bitstringstatuslistcredential">
BitstringStatusListCredential</a> [[VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST]]. See
Section <a href="#convert-status-list-entries"></a> for more details.

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following section describes algorithms for adding and verifying digital
proofs that protect optical information, such as barcodes and machine-readable
zones, on physical media, such as driver's licenses and travel documents.
      </p>

      <p>
Generally speaking, the algorithms in this section are effectively the same
as the ones in the [[[VC-DI-ECDSA]]] [[VC-DI-ECDSA]] except that the
algorithm name is different because the cryptographic hashing process includes
the machine-readable barcode information when calculating the digital signature
such that the optical barcode is protected.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Convert Status List Entries</h3>

        <p>
The algorithm in this section is used to convert the
`TerseBitstringStatusListEntry` to a `BitstringStatusListEntry`, which is used
after verification has been performed on the <a>verifiable credential</a>,
during the validation process.
        </p>

        <p>
After <a>verifiable credential</a> verification has been performed, the
algorithm takes an `OpticalBarcodeCredential` <a>verifiable credential</a>
([=struct=] |vc|) as input and returns a status object ([=map=] |result|) that
contains a [=boolean=] |status| [=map/entry=] and a [=list=] |statusListEntry|
of one or more [=struct=] values representing `BitstringStatusListEntry`
objects.
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Set |result| to be an empty [=map=] and initialize the |result|.|status| value
to `false`.
          </li>
          <li>
Set |year| and |month| to the respective values specified in the
|vc|.|proof|.|created| field.
          </li>
          <li>
Set |didDocument| to be the result of dereferencing |issuer|. If the dereference
does not result in a conforming DID Document, raise an
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#INVALID_CONTROLLER_DOCUMENT">
INVALID_CONTROLLER_DOCUMENT</a> error.
          </li>
          <li>
For each |service| value in |didDocument| where the |service|.|type| is
`BitstringStatusListService`:
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>
Initialize |bslEntry| to an empty [=map=].
              </li>
              <li>
Set |bslEntry|.|type| to `BitstringStatusListEntry`.
              </li>
              <li>
Set |bslEntry|.|statusPurpose| to |service|.|statusPurpose|.
              </li>
              <li>
Set |bslEntry|.|statusListIndex| to |vc|.|credentialStatus|.|index|, ensuring
that the value is converted to a string.
              </li>
              <li>
Set |bslEntry|.|statusListCredential| to |service|.|serviceEndpoint|,
replacing any `{{YYYY}}` text with a four-character representation of |year|
and any `{{MM}}` text with a two-character representation of |month|, using
leading zeros as necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
Add |bslEntry| to |result|.|statusListEntry|.
              </li>
              <li>
Set |result|.|status| to `true`.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
Return |result|.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
Each value in |result|.|statusList| can be used as input to the
<a data-cite="VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST#validate-algorithm">
validation algorithm</a> in the [[[VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST]]] specification.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Status lists are optional">
Implementers are advised that not all <a>issuers</a> will publish status
list information for their <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Some <a>issuers</a>
might require authorization before allowing a <a>verifier</a> to access a
status list credential.

        <h3>ecdsa-vb-2023</h3>

        <p>
The `ecdsa-vb-2023` cryptographic suite takes an input document, canonicalizes
the document using the Universal RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm
[[RDF-CANON]], cryptographically hashes both the original optical barcode
data and the canonicalized verifiable credential data, and then signs the
output resulting in the production of a data integrity proof.
The algorithms in this section also include the verification of such a data
integrity proof.
