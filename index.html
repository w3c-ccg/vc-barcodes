This specification describes a mechanism to protect legacy optical bar codes,
such as those found on driver's licenses (PDF417) and travel documents (MRZ),
using Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]. The Verifiable Credential
representations are compact enough such that they fit in under 140 bytes and
can thus be integrated with traditional two-dimensional bar codes that are
printed on physical cards using legacy printing processes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">

      <p>
This specification is experimental.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
Legacy documentation, such as driver's licenses, passports, and travel
credentials often include machine-readable data that can be used to quickly read
the information from the document. This information is encoded in formats such
as PDF417 [[ISO15438-2015]], machine-readable zone (MRZ) [[ICAO9303-3]], and
other optically scannable codes that are formatted in one-dimensional or
two-dimensional "bars"; thus the phrase "bar code". This information is often
not protected from tampering and the readily available bar code generation and
scanning libraries mean that it is fairly trivial for anyone to generate these
bar codes.
      </p>
      <p>
It is, therefore, useful for an <a>issuer</a> of these bar codes to protect
the information contained within the bar code as well as the entity that
generated the bar code.
      </p>
      <p>
The [[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] specification provides a global standard for
expressing credential information, such as those in a driver's license or
travel document. The [[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] specification provides a global
standard for securing credential information. These two specifications, when
combined, provide a means of protecting credentials from tampering,
expressing authorship of the credential, and providing the current status of
a credential in a privacy-protecting manner. These data formats, however, tend
to be too large to express in an optical bar code.
      </p>
      <p>
The [[[CBOR-LD]]] specification provides a means of compressing secured
<a>verifiable credentials</a> to the point at which it becomes feasible to
express the information as an optical bar code, or embedded within an optical
bar code.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification describes a mechanism to protect legacy optical bar codes,
such as those found on driver's licenses (PDF417) and travel documents (MRZ),
by using a <a>verifiable credential</a> [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] to express
information about the bar code, which is then secured using Data Integrity
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]], and then compressed using CBOR-LD [[CBOR-LD]]. The
resulting <a>verifiable credential</a> representations are compact enough such
that they fit in under 140 bytes and can thus be integrated with traditional
two-dimensional bar codes that are printed on physical cards using legacy
printing processes. This adds tamper resistance to the bar code while
optionally enhancing the bar code to provide information related to whether or
not the physical document has been revoked or suspended by the <a>issuer</a>.
      </p>

        <h3>Driver's License Example</h3>

        <p>
This section provides an example on how the technology in this specification
can be utilized to secure the optical bar code on a driver's license that
uses a PDF417 bar code. We start off with an example driver's license:
        </p>

        <figure id="dl-front">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"

               alt="Picture of the front of a driver's license issued by the state of Utopia which contains a picture of the individual that is the subject of the driver's license along with their attributes, such as name, address, height, weight, eye color, and driving privileges.">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The back of the driver's license contains a PDF417 bar code:
        </p>

        <figure id="dl-back">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"

               alt="Picture of the back of a driver's license issued by the state of Utopia, containing usage rules as well as a PDF417 bar code that encodes much of the information displayed on the front of the card.">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The PDF417 data contains information that is secured using the algorithms
described in this specification. Namely, the PDF417 bar code contains the
following <a>verifiable credential</a>.

        <h3>Employment Authorization Example</h3>

        <p>
This section provides an example on how the technology in this specification
can be utilized to secure the machine-readable zone on an employment
authorization document that uses a machine-readable zone (MRZ) on the back of
the card. We start off with an example employment authorization document:
        </p>

        <figure id="ead-front">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"
               src="diagrams/ead-front.png"
               alt="Picture of the front of an employment authorization document issued by the state of Utopia which contains a picture of the individual that is the subject of the document along with their attributes, such as name, address, height, weight, eye color, and employment privileges.">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The front of an employment authorization document issued by the state of Utopia.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The back of the employment authorization document contains a machine-readable
zone (MRZ) containing information designed to be read through optical character
recognition:
        </p>

        <figure id="ead-back">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; border-radius:15px; width: 50%;"

        <p>
The MRZ data contains information that is secured using the algorithms
described in this specification. Namely, the QR Code on the front of the
card contains the following <a>verifiable credential</a>, which secures
the information on the back of the card.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
to express [=verifiable credentials=] that secure optically printed information
such as bar codes and machine-readable zones on travel documents.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>OpticalBarCodeCredential</h3>

        <p>
An `OpticalBarCodeCredential` is used to secure the contents of an optical
bar code in a way that provides 1) authorship information , 2) tamper
resistance, and 3) optionally, revocation and suspension status. In other words,
the credential can tell you who issued the optical bar code, if the
optical bar code has been tampered with since it was first issued, and
whether or not the <a>issuer</a> of the optical bar code still warrants that
the document is still valid or not. These features provide significant
anti-fraud protections for physical documents.
        </p>

        <p>
The `credentialSubject` of an `OpticalBarCodeCredential` is either a
`Pdf417BarCode` or a `MachineReadableZone`. A `Pdf417BarCode` signifies that
the <a>verifiable credential</a> secures the PDF417 bar code on the physical
document as well as the information expressed in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>. A `MachineReadableZone` signifies that
the <a>verifiable credential</a> secures the machine-readable zone on the
physical document as well as the information expressed in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
In order to achieve as much compression as possible, it is RECOMMENDED that the
`issuer` and `verificationMethod` fields utilize terms from a JSON-LD Context,
which can then be compressed down to a few bytes due to CBOR-LD's semantic
compression mechanism.

        <h3>TerseBitstringStatusListEntry</h3>

        <p>
A `TerseBitstringStatusListEntry` is a subclass of a `BitstringStatusListEntry`
as defined in the [[[VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST]]] specification, where only the
status list index is provided. The location of the status lists are discovered
through the issuer DID Document via the `service` property.
        </p>

        <p>
Using the `issuer` property value in
<a href="#example-an-opticalbarcodecredential-utilizing-a-tersebitstringstatuslistentry">
Example 5</a> above (`did:web:dmv.utopia.example`), dereferencing the DID URL
will result in the DID Document below:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
             title="A did:web DID Document expressing status services">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/vdl/v2"
  ]
  "id": "did:web:dmv.utopia.example",
  "service": [{
    "id": "did:web:dmv.utopia.example#revocation-service",
    "type": "BitstringStatusListService",
    "credentialType": "OpticalBarCodeCredential",
    "statusPurpose": "revocation",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://dmv.utopia.example/status/revocation/{{YYYY}}/{{MM}}"

    "serviceEndpoint": "https://dmv.utopia.example/status/suspension/{{YYYY}}/{{MM}}"
  }]
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The `BitstringStatusListService` identifies a specific type of service that
utilizes a URL template that uses information from the
<a>verifiable credential</a> to determine the revocation and suspension status
list URLs. The `{{YYYY}}` and `{{MM}}` template values are replaced with the
issuance year and month, respectively, of the <a>verifiable credential</a>
which are encoded in the `proof`. The resulting document MUST be a
<a data-cite="VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST#bitstringstatuslistcredential">
BitstringStatusListCredential</a> [[VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST]]. See
Section <a href="#convert-status-list-entries"></a> for more details.

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following section describes algorithms for adding and verifying digital
proofs that protect optical information, such as bar codes and machine-readable
zones, on physical media, such as driver's licenses and travel documents.
      </p>

      <p>
Generally speaking, the algorithms in this section are effectively the same
as the ones in the [[[VC-DI-ECDSA]]] [[VC-DI-ECDSA]] except that the
algorithm name is different because the cryptographic hashing process includes
the machine-readable bar code information when calculating the digital signature
such that the optical bar code is protected.

        <h3>CBOR-LD Compression</h3>

        <p>
This specification requires that an application-specific compression table is
provided to a CBOR-LD processor when encoding and decoding
<a>verifiable credentials</a> of type `OpticalBarCodeCredential`. A registry for
all context URLs for various issuers is <a href="cbor-ld-compression-table.csv">
provided as a comma-separated value file</a> and can be updated and modified via
<a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/verifiable-bar codes/pulls/">
change requests</a> to the file on an append-only and first-come-first-served
basis. Implementations SHOULD retrieve and utilize the latest file on a monthly
basis to ensure that compression and decompression supports the latest values.

        <h3>Convert Status List Entries</h3>

        <p>
The algorithm in this section is used to convert the
`TerseBitstringStatusListEntry` to a `BitstringStatusListEntry`, which is used
after verification has been performed on the <a>verifiable credential</a>,
during the validation process.
        </p>

        <p>
After <a>verifiable credential</a> verification has been performed, the
algorithm takes an `OpticalBarCodeCredential` <a>verifiable credential</a>
([=struct=] |vc|) as input and returns a status object ([=map=] |result|) that
contains a [=boolean=] |status| [=map/entry=] and a [=list=] |statusListEntry|
of one or more [=struct=] values representing `BitstringStatusListEntry`
objects.
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Set |result| to be an empty [=map=] and initialize the |result|.|status| value
to `false`.

Set |year| and |month| to the respective values specified in the
|vc|.|proof|.|created| field.
          </li>

that the value is converted to a string.
              </li>
              <li>
Set |bslEntry|.|statusListCredential| to |service|.|serviceEndpoint|,
replacing any `{{YYYY}}` text with a four-character representation of |year|
and any `{{MM}}` text with a two-character representation of |month|, using
leading zeros as necessary.
